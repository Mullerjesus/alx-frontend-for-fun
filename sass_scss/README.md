# Sass & SCSS Project

This repository contains solutions to the **Sass & SCSS** project tasks as part of the ALX Frontend Specialization. The project involves creating Sass/SCSS files to demonstrate various features of Sass, such as variables, mixins, nesting, loops, imports, and media queries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what Sass is and its benefits.
- Differentiate between Sass and SCSS syntax.
- Explain the Sass preprocessing workflow.
- Use Sass variables, mixins, and nested definitions.
- Import other Sass files and use inheritance.
- Manipulate values using operators.
- Implement loops, conditionals, and media queries in Sass.

## Requirements

### General
- All files are written in **Sass 3.7.4** or higher.
- Files are executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**.
- Files are created using allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Each SCSS file includes a comment block at the top describing the task.
- Each file ends with a new line and adheres to coding standards.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install Ruby** (required for Sass):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y ruby2.5 ruby2.5-dev
   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools
